# Egg Catcher — Browser Game

Simple HTML/CSS/JS "Egg Catcher" game: eggs fall and the player moves a basket to catch them.

How to run locally
1. Create a branch (recommended name `egg-game`) and add these files to the repository root:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
2. Commit and push, or simply open `index.html` in a browser:
   - git checkout -b egg-game
   - git add index.html style.css script.js README.md
   - git commit -m "Add egg catcher browser game"
   - git push -u origin egg-game
3. Open `index.html` in your browser (or host via GitHub Pages).

Notes & ideas
- Add sounds (catch/break) and particle effects for more fun.
- Add levels, power-ups (wider basket, slow-time), and persistent high score storage (localStorage).
- Mobile-friendly improvements: on-screen buttons or swipe control.
